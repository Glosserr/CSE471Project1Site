# My Synthie Project

Building off of step 5 in Multimedia Class at MSU, I developed a synthetic pipe organ! I also added a few effects like vibrato, and a reverb filter!

## Further Info

1. This is a website to present the synth's capabilities, but also allow downloads of the project and materials.
2. You can find samples of the synth on pages relating to the specific features I made!
3. This is a solo project, but built off of already provided code curtoesy of MSU's Computer Science Department.
